# Lite Migrator for mobile devices

Lite Migrator (_SQLite Migrator_) is a tiny SQL migration framework for .NET inspired by [Fluent Migrator](https://github.com/fluentmigrator/fluentmigrator). This framework was built for use with Xamarin üêí projects, so it needs to be quick, simple and reliable when managing databases
